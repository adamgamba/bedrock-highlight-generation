1
00:00:07,699 --> 00:00:09,729
Hardman will bring it out of the end zone.

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:17,530
A pro bowl returner and he's out across the 25 a return of 29 yards where Jimmy Ward

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,360
brings him down.

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,389
You know, when people ask me, as I know they've asked you, Troy

5
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,379
over the last two weeks. Who do you like in this game?

6
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,400
I said, well, you know, you look at San Francisco's defense and you think, man,

7
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:34,990
they can just smother any offense,

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,220
but then there's Patrick Mahomes and he can flat out take over a game.

9
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,270
Yes he can and he is shown, I mean,

10
00:00:41,279 --> 00:00:43,369
he has the ability to throw the football from

11
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,009
anywhere on the field last two playoff games,

12
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,950
he has become a receiving or excuse me, a running threat

13
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,930
as well. So it will be important to hold him within the pocket.

14
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:57,409
Here's a little pitch to Williams running to his right.

15
00:00:57,419 --> 00:00:59,950
The nice pick up on first down is Drake Greenlaw,

16
00:01:00,369 --> 00:01:03,729
the rookie linebacker brings him down after a game of seven.

17
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:05,839
Well,

18
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:07,779
you always come into a game as a quarterback and

19
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,959
kind of wonder how the game's going to be called,

20
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,940
Andy Reid, they started off with uh

21
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:16,180
easy little pitch uh by Patrick Mahomes. This is an offense that

22
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:20,220
does not run the ball a lot on 1st and 2nd down,

23
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:22,930
but try to settle Patrick Mahomes in early.

24
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:23,860
I would expect

25
00:01:24,089 --> 00:01:28,779
some high completion passes here in the early part of this drive

26
00:01:35,809 --> 00:01:39,440
on second down. This one was knocked away

27
00:01:39,919 --> 00:01:42,639
getting a hand on. It was Nick Bosa,

28
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:48,099
the rookie, the pro bowler and a guy who is everywhere for the 49 Ers. Yes.

29
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:52,059
And this will be a match up worth keeping an eye on throughout the the ball game.

30
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:52,500
Nick Bosa.

31
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,099
I've got to believe he lines up on both sides,

32
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,139
but he's going to line up to the offensive right

33
00:01:58,389 --> 00:02:00,059
and work against Derek Fisher.

34
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:05,099
He has shown that he struggles at times against that bull rush.

35
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,809
He's able to get his hand there and then force a third down.

36
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:22,839
This one incomplete for Damian Williams and it's three

37
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,279
and out to start the game for Kansas City,

38
00:02:25,899 --> 00:02:28,839
the top third down offense in the NFL

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,080
come up short on 2nd

40
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,619
and 3rd and 3. It's a good design.

41
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,300
They're going to try to run a pick because the 49 Ers are in

42
00:02:36,309 --> 00:02:40,690
man coverage and if Patrick Mahomes is able to hit him in stride,

43
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:42,110
now you're one on one

44
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,399
on Fred Warner.

45
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:48,889
So nice work by San Francisco in forcing a three and out to start this game. Dustin

46
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:49,490
Colquitt,

47
00:02:49,779 --> 00:02:51,350
two time Pro bowl punter

48
00:02:55,389 --> 00:03:01,850
hits it high for Richie James and he muffed it able to get back on top of it

49
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:06,050
as Byron Pringle was the first guy down field

50
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:13,690
after this 50 yard punt and almost an, uh, oh moment here early in Super Bowl. 54.

51
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,320
Yeah, I mean, nerves are

52
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,740
and showing themselves here in the early going

53
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:24,649
Richie James junior who

54
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:30,429
did not fumble any of his returns during the regular season

55
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:33,940
returning punts and kicks, puts one on the ground but gets it back

56
00:03:34,809 --> 00:03:37,770
to set up San Francisco with their own 18.

57
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:50,119
They run it with Coleman to the right well, played by the Chiefs defense

58
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:51,000
as

59
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:54,789
Nadi was the first guy there and he wasn't alone a loss of one

60
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:04,399
28 year old Jimmy Garoppolo who has just gone 23 and five overall as a starter.

61
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,509
As you see 21 and five

62
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,419
with San Francisco

63
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,399
has not had to do a whole lot.

64
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,929
This postseason threw it 19 times against

65
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,839
the Vikings only eight times against Green Bay

66
00:04:17,178 --> 00:04:18,890
in the NFC championship game

67
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,619
play action, Kittle,

68
00:04:26,029 --> 00:04:27,470
the big tight end

69
00:04:28,089 --> 00:04:30,290
close to first down yardage

70
00:04:30,649 --> 00:04:33,059
and it looks like they're going to give him enough and

71
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,170
they will for a first down a game of 11.

72
00:04:35,269 --> 00:04:39,459
Well, you got to be disciplined on defense for Kansas City, Daniel Sorenson.

73
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,980
He's out there, he's lined up out there with Kettle,

74
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,975
but he's got his eyes in the backfield

75
00:04:44,214 --> 00:04:48,834
and he's looking back in here and as he does that off of that play action.

76
00:04:48,845 --> 00:04:50,635
It gets Kittle right out there in the flat

77
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:54,174
and easy completion for Garoppolo to kind of settle in

78
00:04:54,285 --> 00:04:55,834
and a first down 49er,

79
00:04:55,964 --> 00:04:57,994
third year head coach Kyle Shanahan

80
00:05:00,179 --> 00:05:02,950
calling the plays for this 49er offense.

81
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:09,380
Here's a little toss to Debo

82
00:05:09,589 --> 00:05:12,179
Samuel over the right side. Big play

83
00:05:14,029 --> 00:05:15,269
still going.

84
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,649
And the rookie picks up 32

85
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,950
they're in a too deep shell to start with.

86
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,350
So they're gonna be a little bit short,

87
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:32,589
but you've got Devo Samuel who's gonna come across here, he's gonna get the toss.

88
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,929
You see outside

89
00:05:34,109 --> 00:05:37,630
that Frank Clark, he's got to contain, he gets caught a little bit inside.

90
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,010
Then you've got the kick out

91
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:45,380
in the lead block out in front with Mike mcglinchy and just a great executed play,

92
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,410
well designed

93
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,540
big play.

94
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:54,660
Debo Samuel led all NFL wide receivers during the regular season in rush yards.

95
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,799
He gets 32 there. He's a rookie

96
00:05:59,869 --> 00:06:01,899
here is a hand up to Coleman

97
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,790
and this offensive line is going to work

98
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:08,010
for San Francisco is Kevin Coleman coming off that

99
00:06:08,299 --> 00:06:12,059
dislocated right shoulder. He suffered in the champ game gets seven.

100
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,489
I'll tell you what Joe right now, Kansas City, they,

101
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,880
they are playing more of a too deep look

102
00:06:17,829 --> 00:06:21,059
on first down every first down on this possession.

103
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:25,459
They have gone two deep looks and Garoppolo has the ability to check things.

104
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:28,260
Kyle Shanahan checking that out, seeing what they're doing

105
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,579
and they've gashed him,

106
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,480
you know, with those runs,

107
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,709
they're going to get them out of that in a hurry if

108
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,850
they continue to run the football the way they have here,

109
00:06:35,859 --> 00:06:38,820
we saw first year defensive coordinator Steve Spagnolo

110
00:06:38,829 --> 00:06:40,940
trying to come up with an answer fast.

111
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,220
Here is a handoff to Coleman.

112
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,899
He gets a yard

113
00:06:49,269 --> 00:06:52,890
third down and a couple coming up for the 49 ers,

114
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:57,390
the number four total offense during the regular

115
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:59,540
season and this offensive line was so good

116
00:06:59,549 --> 00:07:01,420
and we probably didn't give them enough credit

117
00:07:01,429 --> 00:07:03,420
for what they did against the Packers defense.

118
00:07:03,429 --> 00:07:07,320
No, they, they have really come on the last six games of the regular season,

119
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:08,540
of course, what they've done

120
00:07:08,769 --> 00:07:10,600
in the postseason right now,

121
00:07:10,809 --> 00:07:12,760
depending on what happens here, Joe, I,

122
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:17,339
I've got to believe Kyle Shanahan is regarding this right now as four down territory

123
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:23,799
Mostert in the ball game.

124
00:07:23,809 --> 00:07:27,410
Here's another toss to Samuel looks like he wants to throw instead,

125
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,269
he'll just pick it up with his legs

126
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,750
first down San Francisco in a game of seven

127
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,130
as Anthony Hitchens made the stop and the impressive drive

128
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:39,130
continues for Kyle Shanahan.

129
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,720
Well, they were definitely going to throw it but watch Derek

130
00:07:41,859 --> 00:07:43,690
Naty, they were going to come back to, to

131
00:07:43,929 --> 00:07:46,200
Jimmy Garoppolo on the throwback

132
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:51,809
and Naddy, he recognizes it. He gets out there. Is he going to be able to make a play?

133
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,369
I don't know, but good enough

134
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,059
for Debo Samuel to tuck it

135
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:59,730
and then go and pick up the first down good decision on his part.

136
00:07:59,739 --> 00:08:03,489
He's a big bodied wide receiver £215

137
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:07,980
any way they can, they want to put it in his hands. They've done it twice.

138
00:08:07,989 --> 00:08:11,220
Couple trick plays already by Shanahan on this opening drive,

139
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:15,049
heavy pressure pass is caught by Mostert

140
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:18,760
and he is swallowed up immediately by Mike Pinnell.

141
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:18,899
A

142
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:20,510
game of two

143
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,529
Toya's defense got better and better as the season went on.

144
00:08:26,559 --> 00:08:30,959
They are missing a couple of big pieces including their rookie free safety

145
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:34,380
Juan Thornhill who went down week 17 with a torn AC L.

146
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:34,530
Yeah.

147
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:38,359
And that was fairly significant although Daniel sort and he has stepped in a guy

148
00:08:38,369 --> 00:08:42,169
who was a starter a couple of years ago and here he is back here and

149
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,330
he's done, he's done a good job in the two postseason games, but you're right.

150
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,780
They have shown improvement coming off one of their best performances

151
00:08:49,789 --> 00:08:52,570
if not their best performance in the AFC championship game.

152
00:08:53,419 --> 00:08:57,169
Here's a throw to Samuel. Nothing there. Kettles

153
00:08:57,289 --> 00:08:57,919
block

154
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,479
taken care of by the Kansas City defense as Basho

155
00:09:02,979 --> 00:09:05,260
Breland got through and made the stop a

156
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,400
loss of two really great job by Basho

157
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:12,770
Breland in, in being physical and playing through the block,

158
00:09:12,789 --> 00:09:14,119
the throw a little bit high.

159
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,330
So he's not able to catch that on the move.

160
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:31,280
And now third down in 10 as Jeff Wilson checks in for the first time in the game.

161
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:34,880
Here's Freddie Clark at the top.

162
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:36,799
He's been on a tear

163
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:41,780
penalty, flags, free play passes dropped by Wilson.

164
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,780
They like him catching it out of the backfield

165
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,489
hasn't been active since week 15.

166
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,210
No activity in the postseason dropped it,

167
00:09:51,739 --> 00:09:52,369
but it looked like

168
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,919
passio came across early

169
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:57,940
left side

170
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:01,340
defense number 55 5 yard penalty

171
00:10:01,849 --> 00:10:02,830
deep third down.

172
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,739
They say that it was Frank Clark but passing

173
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:10,080
right

174
00:10:10,289 --> 00:10:15,359
there. Yeah, right there. He slides inside and number 92 and he's had a nice

175
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:19,289
couple of games also here in the postseason and now they make it a more manageable.

176
00:10:19,299 --> 00:10:20,049
Third and five.

177
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:24,280
You bring up a good point, Joe with the running back, Jeff Wilson, he's not as fast

178
00:10:24,669 --> 00:10:26,359
as the others that they have,

179
00:10:26,369 --> 00:10:30,080
but he gives them the best opportunity of coming out of the backfield

180
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,280
and being a receiving threat and

181
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,489
that's an advantage for the 49 Ers against the line backing for in Kansas City.

182
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,270
That's not great cover guys.

183
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,609
They're down in five

184
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:50,179
good protection for Garoppolo and the pass is incomplete. Looked like it was Tip.

185
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,700
Damien Wilson may have gotten a hand on it

186
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,500
to bring up fourth down.

187
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,219
Well, Steve

188
00:10:57,429 --> 00:10:59,599
Spagnolo, you're gonna double up George Kittle,

189
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,929
you're gonna get underneath him and take him away in that situation.

190
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,070
Third and five and

191
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:08,429
Garoppolo has to go elsewhere. That's immediately where he was looking to go.

192
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,280
And so Kansas City, although 49er able to put together a pretty good drive.

193
00:11:13,289 --> 00:11:15,760
They're at least able to make a stop and that's gonna be a key.

194
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:19,469
Both these offenses come into this game in the postseason

195
00:11:19,789 --> 00:11:22,299
having played well in the red zone.

196
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,940
Robbie Gold from 38

197
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:30,640
first points of the game belong to the 49er.

198
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,700
Kansas City went three and out.

199
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:38,700
San Francisco got into field goal range and the vet Robbie Gold knocked it through

200
00:11:38,929 --> 00:11:41,429
just underway in Super Bowl 54

201
00:11:42,219 --> 00:11:45,020
stram. The Hall of Famer, the late great Hank Stram

202
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,229
that never gets old.

203
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,359
It just doesn't.

204
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:48,830
And I got to know Hank

205
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:50,390
early on in my life,

206
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:55,260
he was my dad's radio broadcast partner on Monday night football on CBS radio and

207
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,880
that was Hank. You got good.

208
00:11:59,869 --> 00:12:02,489
Save those for the uh post game.

209
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:08,919
Look how things have changed since Super Bowl four. It was the 69 season

210
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:13,020
January of 1970. The average ticket price is,

211
00:12:13,349 --> 00:12:14,450
it's a little more steep

212
00:12:14,739 --> 00:12:17,239
cost of a 32nd commercial.

213
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,929
A lot more steep

214
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:22,750
halftime acting and the play by play guys. I I

215
00:12:22,969 --> 00:12:26,619
how about that? The, the more things change, the more they stay the same.

216
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,210
Congratulations pal. I know that's meaningful to you as it should be and

217
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:36,340
Austin will be working alongside you tonight. Thank you, buddy. It is to my mom.

218
00:12:36,349 --> 00:12:37,020
I know that

219
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:43,130
from the 25 Mahomes out to his right, finds Tyreek Hill and he gets nine.

220
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:50,489
Take a look at the defense for San Francisco.

221
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,640
The Chiefs now have opened every game this postseason with a three and out

222
00:12:56,099 --> 00:12:59,690
and that was against Houston then against Tennessee and we look at his defense

223
00:12:59,809 --> 00:13:03,330
that held Kansas City to a three and out first time they had the football.

224
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:09,840
Yeah,

225
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,369
Damian Williams cuts back gets a first down

226
00:13:22,929 --> 00:13:24,729
boso with the stop a game of two.

227
00:13:28,969 --> 00:13:32,760
This offense, Joe for Kansas City. We, we talk about once

228
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,690
Patrick Mahomes came back off of the injury.

229
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,719
They played good but not as well as they'd played early in the season.

230
00:13:38,729 --> 00:13:42,210
A lot of changes too along that offensive line, a lot of injuries,

231
00:13:42,219 --> 00:13:44,909
5 to 6 different offensive line combinations,

232
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:48,479
they were finally able to settle in same five starters.

233
00:13:48,489 --> 00:13:51,169
Now, the last five games and that's made a difference.

234
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:52,820
Maholmes slings it.

235
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,469
Tyree Kill makes a move gets a couple of

236
00:13:55,479 --> 00:13:58,179
extra yards as he got away from Richard Sherman

237
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,859
and a game of eight

238
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:03,640
as Kwan Williams eventually made the stop.

239
00:14:03,739 --> 00:14:04,080
Well,

240
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:09,150
you've got Tyreek Hill out there and we all know no one on the field can run with him

241
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,130
and you've got Sherman out there one on one. So he's certainly going to guard

242
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,179
against him running by him. But

243
00:14:15,409 --> 00:14:21,239
the key in this game really for both defenses, it is going to be the ability to limit

244
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,109
the yards after the catch.

245
00:14:23,119 --> 00:14:26,419
Both of them throughout the year have been outstanding in that area.

246
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,919
Second down in two Mahomes

247
00:14:34,809 --> 00:14:37,989
back pedaling as he throws high for Williams

248
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:39,659
32

249
00:14:42,119 --> 00:14:45,409
penalty flag on the play on the far side of the field.

250
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,539
The call from Bill Vinovich working his second Super Bowl.

251
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:00,809
Yes.

252
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,200
Piece this thing together, Joe.

253
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:09,799
But it looked to me like they had illegal man downfield. It's,

254
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,000
you know, they run that,

255
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:15,479
that read option and when it's not handed off and the ball doesn't come out on time.

256
00:15:15,489 --> 00:15:15,919
You're gonna,

257
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:17,440
the receiver downfield

258
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,289
offense over 72

259
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:19,960
pens

260
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:20,780
decline

261
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,080
held to the play

262
00:15:22,359 --> 00:15:23,010
third down.

263
00:15:26,219 --> 00:15:27,729
So they get Eric Fisher,

264
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,770
the penalties decline to bring up third down.

265
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:36,460
Got Kelsea, he's coming across, he's trying to,

266
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:40,099
to help secure in the fact that if Mahomes does keep it,

267
00:15:40,109 --> 00:15:41,739
they got Fisher being down field

268
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:47,900
now third down in two and the hand off for the first down to Damian Williams,

269
00:15:50,719 --> 00:15:55,489
the 49 Ers declined the penalty and on third and short a game of five,

270
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,919
Kansas City went 12 to 4.

271
00:15:57,929 --> 00:15:59,650
They won the AFC West

272
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,179
Patrick Mahomes,

273
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:06,140
the third player in NFL history to win an MVP award which he did last year

274
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:10,659
and make a super bowl over his first three seasons joining Marino and Warner

275
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:16,200
and they overcame 10 plus point deficits in both postseason games so far,

276
00:16:18,309 --> 00:16:20,679
quick throw pass quite. That's Kelsey,

277
00:16:21,979 --> 00:16:23,159
he gets nine

278
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:24,469
Duski

279
00:16:24,979 --> 00:16:26,859
Tart down field to make the stop.

280
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:30,309
Oh, the play action in the backfield holds Fred Warner.

281
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,799
It keeps him from being able to get over there to make the play

282
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:37,080
on this throw, watch what the action in the backfield does.

283
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:38,960
And then that creates the little lane there

284
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:40,349
to, to get it in there to

285
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:45,390
Travis Kelsey. And so for, for an offense that doesn't run the ball really all that.

286
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,669
Well, they're awfully good in their play action passing.

287
00:16:48,849 --> 00:16:50,590
It proves the theory that you don't have to be

288
00:16:50,599 --> 00:16:53,469
a great running team to have great play action game.

289
00:16:53,859 --> 00:16:56,510
Here's Williams another first down and more

290
00:16:57,369 --> 00:17:01,729
down inside the 30 where Sherman makes the stop in a game of 15.

291
00:17:05,898 --> 00:17:10,428
Well, you get movement like this on Sheldon day, the defensive tackle,

292
00:17:10,438 --> 00:17:12,898
the push that the Chiefs are able to get on him,

293
00:17:13,009 --> 00:17:14,868
he just completely gets wiped out.

294
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:19,698
They're in the middle of the field and it opens up a heck of a lane for Damian Williams.

295
00:17:20,068 --> 00:17:23,979
Chiefs started this game with LaShawn mccoy, not active.

296
00:17:23,989 --> 00:17:27,318
So Darwin Thompson is the backup to Williams

297
00:17:27,438 --> 00:17:28,417
and he's in there. Now.

298
00:17:29,139 --> 00:17:30,598
The rookie from Utah State

299
00:17:33,739 --> 00:17:35,469
riddle tossed to Hill

300
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:39,109
makes a move and Warner doesn't bite,

301
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:43,270
forced out of bounds after a game of four.

302
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,760
The Pepsi Super Bowl 54 half time show is coming up

303
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:48,469
right here on Fox

304
00:17:54,329 --> 00:17:57,449
second down at six in what has been a fast

305
00:17:57,459 --> 00:18:00,500
paced first quarter here in Miami under four to go.

306
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,380
I like what Andy Reid has done here on this drive.

307
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:06,660
He's balanced up the run pass and he's been able to hit him

308
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,300
a couple of times

309
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,540
with the running game.

310
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:13,869
Good night

311
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:22,319
free play on second down pass is caught. Kelsey makes a move inside the 15

312
00:18:28,489 --> 00:18:32,390
Earl Mitchell came across early and on this free play they get 11.

313
00:18:32,729 --> 00:18:33,329
Well, you see Emmanuel

314
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,050
Moseley

315
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,199
declined. That's

316
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:36,869
helping the play.

317
00:18:38,089 --> 00:18:41,160
That's the challenge in trying to cover a guy like Travis Kelsey,

318
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:43,500
even though you have a corner on him,

319
00:18:43,734 --> 00:18:48,744
a big physical guy at 652 60 he's able to get physical at the top of the route.

320
00:18:48,755 --> 00:18:50,375
Create separation,

321
00:18:50,555 --> 00:18:54,505
the 49ers because Patrick Mahomes held the count.

322
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:58,954
He's able to see exactly that pressure coming off the edge. He knew he had one on one

323
00:18:59,525 --> 00:19:00,685
with Travis Kelsey

324
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:05,920
with that

325
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,709
on first down Mahomes put

326
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:11,459
down.

327
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:16,530
Buckner was there, joined by Earl Mitchell in a loss of one.

328
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:26,510
Well, they take care of, of, of Hill on the back end. They run four cross zone

329
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,550
and they're just making sure that

330
00:19:29,069 --> 00:19:30,989
they're gonna make him throw it underneath and then

331
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,910
come up and rally and make the play.

332
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,229
But the pass rush this time is able to get home

333
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,569
Sherman on Chelsea right here.

334
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:48,040
Right.

335
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:53,479
Maholm swings it high and incomplete for Hill

336
00:19:56,219 --> 00:20:00,640
had to change the arm angle and Mahomes is an expert

337
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:03,020
at that but could not complete it to Tyreek Hill.

338
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:06,680
I think if you look at this Joe and just like Kansas City,

339
00:20:06,689 --> 00:20:11,589
even though the 49 ers were able to move the football, they force a field goal.

340
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,369
I think it's going to be that type of game. The, the 49er will be happy

341
00:20:16,709 --> 00:20:21,390
if, if they give up yardage and all Kansas City has to show for it is,

342
00:20:21,569 --> 00:20:23,709
is three points at the end of these drives

343
00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:27,030
to a play of this drive, it's covered 5.5 minutes.

344
00:20:33,979 --> 00:20:35,810
3rd and 11 Mahomes

345
00:20:36,709 --> 00:20:40,939
will try to run and get it. Ball gets knocked out.

346
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,920
He had picked up first down yardage.

347
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:47,670
The ball went out of bounds on the hit by Jimmy Ward and we'll see where they put it

348
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,939
and Ward is down.

349
00:20:57,239 --> 00:20:59,199
We'll see where the ball is spotted

350
00:21:00,689 --> 00:21:02,780
as Jimmy Ward is checked

351
00:21:02,989 --> 00:21:06,229
by the medical staff for San Francisco back after this,

352
00:21:07,449 --> 00:21:11,089
but Jimmy Ward is ok. Popped up, jogged over to the sideline.

353
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:16,689
Here's the collision Mahomes had the first down but with this hit and it was

354
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,589
a big hit right on the football.

355
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,650
He lost the first down yardage.

356
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:26,800
So it's fourth down and one and Troy after initially sending Harrison but

357
00:21:26,979 --> 00:21:28,770
out to try the field goal,

358
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:32,640
Andy Reid is going to go for it and I will tell you San Francisco defensively,

359
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,880
they are the best in the NFL

360
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,530
in stopping teams on 3rd and 4th and 1,

361
00:21:39,719 --> 00:21:41,209
we'll see what happens here.

362
00:21:41,219 --> 00:21:41,719
But yes,

363
00:21:41,729 --> 00:21:43,650
when they had the kicking team out to settle

364
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,930
for the field goal was a little surprised by that

365
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,140
a shift and a direct snap.

366
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:53,530
It's Williams

367
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:55,579
just

368
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,750
short of the touchdown but a first down

369
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,930
as Damian Williams gets four.

370
00:22:04,469 --> 00:22:04,489
Yeah,

371
00:22:06,619 --> 00:22:08,410
right now ruled short

372
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:13,219
of breaking the plane of the goal line and a good call

373
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,989
real good call. So Andy Reid, he pulls a little trick play out of his own.

374
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,380
You got Mahomes and that move there on the shift then gives

375
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:25,560
free access for Williams in order to get the snap from center

376
00:22:25,739 --> 00:22:27,219
and he just hit it right up the gut.

377
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:33,189
Now, first in gold

378
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,979
from just inside the one here's the rookie

379
00:22:38,469 --> 00:22:39,979
and driving

380
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:45,010
no signal yet. They're gonna mark him short. That's Darwin Thompson

381
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:49,280
who had one rushing touchdown all season

382
00:22:49,439 --> 00:22:52,189
and had only one carry this postseason

383
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,780
before the Super Bowl.

384
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:57,569
Yeah, most of his carries came towards the end of the season and a

385
00:22:57,969 --> 00:23:02,260
lot of trust right there for the rookie down there in a Super Bowl on the goal line.

386
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,939
A lot of bodies. Everybody's reaching for the football

387
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:09,410
now. Second in goal.

388
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,109
Yes,

389
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,000
Mahomes

390
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,180
looking to flip, takes it in for the touchdown.

391
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:42,189
Well, the action in the backfield as Mahomes pivots around Duski

392
00:23:42,729 --> 00:23:43,069
Tart.

393
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:47,839
He, he's kind of in no man's land at that point, the linebackers were out of position

394
00:23:48,089 --> 00:23:51,160
and if he tries to come up and take Mahomes, he pitches it out.

395
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:52,869
It's a walk in either way.

396
00:23:53,209 --> 00:23:54,510
That's a, that's a great job.

397
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,969
Good decision by Andy Reid going forward on fourth

398
00:23:56,979 --> 00:23:59,439
down and capitalizing and coming away with a touchdown.

399
00:23:59,449 --> 00:24:00,280
No team,

400
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:03,130
no head coach went for it fewer times this regular

401
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:06,349
season on fourth down than Andy Reid just 10 times

402
00:24:06,939 --> 00:24:09,520
but he goes for it here down by three in the Super

403
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:09,959
Bowl.

404
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:14,260
It leads to the touchdown

405
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:16,560
and a four point lead.

406
00:24:19,579 --> 00:24:22,250
Patrick Mahomes has been the Chiefs

407
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,310
leading rusher this postseason.

408
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:29,270
He's been doing it all thrilling those fans watching back at Chiefs

409
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:32,430
their first Super bowl in 50 years

410
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,270
takes it in from a yard out.

411
00:24:35,729 --> 00:24:38,989
Capping a 15 play, 75 yard drive,

412
00:24:39,229 --> 00:24:41,770
almost 7.5 minutes on the clock.

413
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:52,489
Richie James waits for the kick from but

414
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:56,550
he won't touch it.

415
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:03,170
Chris Meyers pretty big hit put on Patrick Mahomes by Jimmy Ward

416
00:25:03,979 --> 00:25:08,560
and afterwards he came over to the chief sideline and they were fired up Mahomes who

417
00:25:08,829 --> 00:25:12,010
on that third down hit did not receive any medical attention,

418
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:15,729
but he told his teammates and I'm paraphrasing here, you know, we can handle this.

419
00:25:15,739 --> 00:25:17,729
Let's stay tough and even heads turn

420
00:25:17,895 --> 00:25:18,364
on the, uh,

421
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:22,324
some of the defensive players on the sideline and it appeared his toughness in that

422
00:25:22,334 --> 00:25:26,015
moment had something to do or at least influence the team going forward on fourth

423
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:27,564
in the eventual touchdown.

424
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:30,305
Nick Chris, he played through that early ankle injury,

425
00:25:30,314 --> 00:25:35,344
then dislocated his kneecap in that game on a Thursday night in Denver week seven,

426
00:25:35,354 --> 00:25:36,665
missed only two games

427
00:25:40,469 --> 00:25:45,500
from the 25 now trailing by 4 49ers throw with Garoppolo

428
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:50,189
in finding a hole in this defense downfield Emanuel Sanders.

429
00:25:50,239 --> 00:25:50,250
Uh,

430
00:25:50,479 --> 00:25:51,969
we've seen Kansas City,

431
00:25:51,979 --> 00:25:55,390
they've run the two deep on early downs on the first couple possessions.

432
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,300
Now they go single high.

433
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:58,969
They're gonna start creeping up trying to play that run game.

434
00:25:58,979 --> 00:26:02,589
Now off of play action, you see that nice window there

435
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:05,219
that Jimmy Garoppolo has and

436
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:09,099
that is a good feeling for a quarterback when you come off of that

437
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,719
look and you've got that kind of room to fit it in there.

438
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:13,719
73 ball game in Super Bowl.
