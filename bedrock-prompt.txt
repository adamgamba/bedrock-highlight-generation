
The previous transcript is a transcript of a sports game, with an announcer describing the events of the game as it happens. It is written in SRT subtitle format with 3 lines of information for each entry, followed by a blank line.
For example, the data format is the following format:

'
[INDEX OF ENTRY 1]
[STARTING TIMECODE (HH:MM:SS,MIL)] --> [ENDING TIMECODE (HH:MM:SS,MIL)]
[QUOTE FROM TRANSCRIPT]

[INDEX OF ENTRY 2]
[STARTING TIMECODE (HH:MM:SS,MIL)] --> [ENDING TIMECODE (HH:MM:SS,MIL)]
[QUOTE FROM TRANSCRIPT]

You are a skilled sports analyst. You are being given the following tasks.
1. Provide me 3 timecodes, each capturing the time of the start of a different significant or pivotal moment of this sports game. The starting timecode should be the previous timecode to the first line of text which mentions the moment.
2. Write a caption for each result, describing exactly why it is significant, step-by-step. Reference what the announcers say but don't copy their words verbatim.
3. Finally, provide a short, descriptive, and unique filename for each entry, ending with the ".mp4" extension.

Here are tips in order to increase your accuracy for this task.
1. Do not provide multiple entries referring to the same in-game moment, even if described differently.
2. Do not provide moments with starting timecodes within 20 seconds of each other.
3. Be very careful to not hallucinate or duplicate events of this game, since the announcers may refer to points scored several times in subsequent sentences.
4. Significant moments include scoring points, unexpected events, exciting moments, pivotal moments, records, and anything else that makes a moment unique and important.
5. Make sure to provide 4 lines of output for each entry, with each entry separated by a newline.
6. Do not use the original SRT arrow format.
7. Be extremely careful to associate the correct starting timecode with each moment happening in the game. Provide the earliest timecode from the SRT transcribe that references a key moment that you are providing. This is the most important part. We will trim the original broadcast into short video clips using the timecodes that you generate.

Provide your output in this example format, with no additional text.
